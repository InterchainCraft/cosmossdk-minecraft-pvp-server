# Follows convention from holographic displays to make it simple
# To move over too. Does not support items or animations
#
# This does however support PAPI global placeholders (ex. %server_online%)
# Trying to use a placeholder such as %player_killstats% would not work.
# If you need support for that, please continue to use holo displays
# and disable in ServerTools config.yml for Holograms: false.
