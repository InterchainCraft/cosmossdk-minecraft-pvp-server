# CosmosSDK PvP

CosmosSDK PvP is a soon-to-be Minecraft server launched on Juno.

The idea is as follows:

- A Duels Minecraft server (Player vs Player)
- Each player bets X amount of a token (JUNO or axlUSDC)
- These are then deposited into an escrow contract on behalf of both.
- Once both accept, they are teleported into an arena to fight.
- After the battle is over, the loser's tokens will be available for redemption from the winner.

This will be done my modifying my integration plugin found here
